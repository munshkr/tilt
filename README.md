# Tilt

Bytebeat-inspired live coding thingie for waveshaping synthesis.

Runs on modern browsers using the WebAudio API.

## Usage

To make some audio, define the value of the variable `o`. It must be a number
between 0 and 1. For this, you can use the `t` parameter, which is an
always-increasing counter.

For example, to make a sine wave at 440hz:

```javascript
o = sine(t);
```

Evaluate code by pressing the Play button, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>
(or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>). You can stop sound by pressing the
Stop button, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd>.

You can make all sorts of simple (and more complex) waveforms:

```javascript
// saw wave
let q = 2 * pi;
o = (t % q) / q;
```

```javascript
// square wave
let q = 2 * pi;
o = (t % q) / q > 0.5;
```

```javascript
// pulse wave with pulse-width modulation
let q = 2 * pi;
o = (t % q) / q > seq(256, 64) / 64;
```

```javascript
// triangle wave
let ramp = (t % q) / q;
o = ((ramp > 0.5 ? ramp : 1 - ramp) - 0.5) * 2;
```

These simple _waveforms_ are also already defined as functions. Read below.

There is also a parameter `K` which is static and represents the number of
samples in a _cycle_. It is used to make _rhythm_. See the function `seq` or
`randInt`, as they use it internally.

A more complex example, using some of the functions described below:

```javascript
o = sine(t / (randInt(8, 32) + 1)) * env(8, 1) * 0.75;
o +=
  sine((t * aseq(16, [2, 3, 2, 7, 8])) / 4 + sine((t / aseq(8, [1, 2])) * 1.0001)) *
  invEnv(seq1(32, 8), seq1(4, 8) + 1) *
  0.75;
```

Remember that `o` should be a number between 0 and 1. If you add multiple
waveforms, you should scale them down to mix them properly. For example,
instead of:

```javascript
o = sine(t) + tri(t);
```

You should do something like this:

```javascript
o = sine(t) * 0.5 + tri(t) * 0.5;
```

Why 0.5? Because both `sine(t)` and `tri(t)` output values from 0 to 1. If
you multiply them with 0.5 (or divide them by 2), they should range between 0
and 0.5, which when both are added up, they end up ranging from 0 to 1.

## Functions

Code is written in JavaScript, but there are some useful constants and
functions available.

### Math

Most of the functions from `Math` object in JavaScript are defined as globals,
but the following are the most useful:

- `pi`: Pi constant.
- `two_pi`: 2 times Pi
- `abs(arg)`: Returns the absolute value of a number.
- `sin(arg)`: Returns the sine of a number.
- `tan(arg)`: Returns the tangent value of a number.
- `tanh(arg)`: Returns the hyperbolic tangent value of a number.
- `floor(arg)`: Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given
  number.
- `ceil(arg)`: Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given
  number.
- `pow(arg)`: Returns base to the exponent power.
- `round(arg)`: Returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.
- `sqrt(arg)`: Returns the positive square root of a number.

Note: `sin` returns a number from -1 to 1, there is also `sine` which
returns a number from 0 to 1, suitable as audio output.

### Waveforms

These functions all return numbers from 0 to 1, so they can be used directly as
audio output.

- `sine(t)`: Sine waveform
- `saw(t)`: Saw waveform
- `pulse(t, width)`: Pulse waveform
- `square(t)`: Square waveform (same as Pulse with width 0.5)
- `tri(t)`: Triangle waveform

### Sequences

- `seq(subdiv, subdiv)`: Returns a number from 0 to `length - 1` in `subdiv`
  subdivisions of a cycle (defined by `K`).
- `seq1(subdiv, length)`: Same as `seq`, but number range from 1 to `length`.
  subdivisions of a cycle (defined by `K`).
- `aseq(subdiv, array)`: Returns values from `array` in `subdiv` subdivisions
  of a cycle. Basically, sequences an array.

### Envelopes

- `env(subdiv, curve, smooth)`: Generates an exponential envelope that lasts
  `subdiv` subdivisions of a cycle, with an exponent `curve`. The optional
  `smooth` argument is a 0-1 number that splits the envelope into an increasing
  linear ramp for a smoother attack (0=no smoothing, 1=linear ramp).
- `invEnv(subdiv, curve, smooth)`: Same as `env` but generates an inverse
  exponential envelope. The `smooth` argument controls a decreasing ramp at the
  end of the envelope.

### Random

- `rand(subdiv, seed)`: Returns a random number between 0 and 1. The number is
  held during `subdiv` subdivisions of a cycle. When using the same `seed` you
  can generate the same sequence of random numbers.
- `randInt(subdiv, max, seed)`: Same as `rand` but generates a integer numbers
  from 0 to `max`.

### Time

These functions generally replace the use of the `t` counter variable for musically-related concepts:

- `f(frequency)`: Generates a counter at the specified frequency (e.g.
  `sine(f(440)) == sine(t)`).
- `m(midinote)`: Generates a counter at the specified MIDI note (e.g.
  `sine(m(69)) == sine(t)`, because 69 is the A4, which is 440Hz).
